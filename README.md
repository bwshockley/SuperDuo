# SuperDuo
Two Android applications to demonstrate various programming guildlines.  Part of the Android nanodegree program through Udacity and Google.

These two applications were part of the Advanced Android App Development course at Udacity.  The football scores app uses Tabed pageviews to look at the past 2 days, current day, and next 2 days of football scores.
The Alexandria app is a list for keeping track of books.  It has implemented barcode scanning using Google Play Services 8.3 mobile vision.

## Motivation

These apps were created as part of the Android nanodegree program through Udacity and Google.

## Installation

Import these apps into Android Studio and then install on device.

## Contributors

Udacity provided the templates for these two apps, but I added in the barcode scanning feature, the scrolling Android widget, fixed errors, improved the UI, and provided a cleaner overall experience.
